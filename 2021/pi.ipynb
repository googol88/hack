Thus, if one takes a single random point, uniformally distributed in the square, the probability of landing within the circle is $\\pi/4.$ Moreover, we can conclude if we take an infinite number of points, the ratio of the total number of points that fall within the circle, to that of the total number of points sampled will equal $\\pi/4.$ This is the essense of Monte Carlo sampling.
